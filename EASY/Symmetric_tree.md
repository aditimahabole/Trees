**4.Symmetric Tree**

**Link**: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/symmetric-tree/1

**Explain **: 
- If root1 is NULL and also root2 is NULL return true as they are symmetric
- if root1 is not NULL and also root2 is not NULL and value is same 
- then move root1 to left and root2 to right to check if they are symmetric 
- and  then also go to roo1->right , root2 ->left to check symmetric nature, return the bool value simple.
