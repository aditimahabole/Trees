**9.Children Sum Parent**

**Link** : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/children-sum-parent/1

**Explain** : 
- so we have to check if root data is equal to sum of left node and right node ,
- and we have to do it for each node like sum of its left and right is equal then we return 1 else 0 
- here if node is leaf node so we are returning 1 means true 
- and we are checking if sum is equal root data at every node.
